                Paul Raymonda Park has been around longer than I can remember. It was the first park I ever went to in New York when I came to America. I touched down at JFK in the summer of 2013. I had a hard time making friends in my ESL class, and all the other Greek kids were either in advanced classes or at other schools. My only friend was Angel, a Mexican boy who had also just arrived in New York. No language barrier existed between us, we understood each other through similar struggles. He invited me to go to the park with him one day. I was so excited, I ran to my father’s car and asked if he could take me for five minutes. He said yes. I was so happy as we drove towards the park. I had a lot of fun at the park that day, and although Angel and I separated after I passed my ESL test in 4th grade, the park has stayed with me to this day.

                Every day, I visited my new friend. My house, with no TV, no couch, not even a bed at the time, was just a boring part of my life. The park ignited a flame in my heart, made me go back every day, just to look around, watch the other kids playing, heard the basketball hitting the worn-down court, smelling barbeques from nearby houses, feeling the old wooden benches, thankful I had someplace to sit away from the cold pavement. Day by day, in my hand-me-down clothes, I’d make my way to 48th. I was a strange kid back then; I never spoke to anyone I didn’t know, I was shy, small, and foreign to this vast environment full of people I’d never come across. No kid at the time knew what bullying was, why it was wrong. I, on the other hand, became acquainted with it from an early age. Kids at the park made fun of me for any little thing they could think of. It made me hate the park. A few years passed without going to the park at all. Towards the end of elementary school until the middle of middle school, I barely went. I’d joined a basketball team at a school my mom worked at. I liked it, but I sucked. Eventually I gained the confidence to go to the park. I was bigger, better, smarter.  I played basketball there for the first time. I made a few friends after that day. We exchanged numbers, played together. I'm still friends with most. Steezy, a kid one1 year older than me, is a really good friend of mine to this day. We played a lot together. I’ve even beat the kids who made fun of me, called me trash. Now they call me asking me to hoop. I find it hilarious. Nearly eight8 years later, I’m still here, the same little boy I was then. But I’m not little anymore, I’m not shy, I’m not a stranger anymore.

                Throughout my life here, I’ve learned quite a few things about the park. It has its own unique problems no other park has. Where do I begin? Maybe from Adriko, a little kid, about ten10 years old. I’ve only known him for a few years, but from our first interaction, he’s always been annoying. He’s one of those kids that run around the park, yelling, cursing, and throwing stuff at people, and when you tell them to leave, their mother gets mad at you and defends her son’s actions with the fact that “this is a public park” and therefore Adriko can do whatever he wants. Simply ignoring Adriko, thankfully, makes him disappear, and the park reappears in my vision. There are the occasional kids that smoke at the basketball courts or the parents yelling at their kids, or the motorcyclist that rides into the open area of the park and does wheelies. However, that doesn't make me see the park any differently than a second home.

                Compared to other parks, 48th is a whole different world. Although it’s a public park like all the others, and it’s visited by the same type of people, 48th is much different in my mind and heart, as I’m sure it is for many others. 48th only has a single basketball court, an open space for community activities, a swingset, and a playground along with a fountain kids play in. Those things are probably in every other park in New York, but what makes this one unique are the people. No other park has a Greek lady who carries a whole gym worth of bikes and balls for her kids to play with. There’s no other place in New York where you can find that many basketball coaches at once. Where else could you find so many OGs playing ball together, so many kids sitting on swings and laughing about what happened at school the day before. The answer is; nowhere. I believe everyone says this about something they find to be important to them, and although it may be untrue, my park is the only one of its kind. 1 of 1, this is my park, and I love everything about it.
